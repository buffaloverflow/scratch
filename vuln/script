./vuln1
  1) "vuln"  see details as expected
  2) "../../../../../etc/shadow"  directory traversal!
  3) "$(id)" command injection!

./vuln2
  1) "$(id)" no more command injection!
  2) "' $(id) '" command injection is back!
  3) "                            id "  command injection via buffer overflow
  4) one way to fix the previous problems is to move the buffer, but that doesn't make us secure
  5) "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA..." segfault b/c stack bof
